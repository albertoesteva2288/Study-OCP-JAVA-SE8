	//1 the protocol jdbc (this one is always same) 
	//2 the name of database product (for example , it can be mysql, postgresql and derby which is inside the JDK)
	//3 the rest of it, which contains the location ( it is possibly omitted )and the name of the database.
	//  good url example can be:jdbc:derby:zoo, jdbc:postgresql://localhost/zoo , jdbc:oracle:thin@123.123.123.123:1521:zoo
